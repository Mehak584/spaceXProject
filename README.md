# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

 ### Frameworks ###
### ReactJS
ReactJS is a popular front-end library used for building dynamic user interfaces. It is known for its simplicity, high performance, and component-based architecture. ReactJS uses a Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to optimize performance and provide seamless user experience.

We chose ReactJS for this project because of its popularity, ease of use, and flexibility. Additionally, it has a large community and a vast ecosystem of tools and libraries.

### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides pre-designed classes for styling web applications. It is known for its flexibility and allows developers to easily create custom designs using pre-defined utility classes. Tailwind CSS is also easy to learn and use, which makes it a great choice for rapid development.

We chose Tailwind CSS for this project because it is lightweight, easy to use, and provides a set of pre-defined classes that can be customized as per the requirements. Additionally, it has a good documentation and a community of developers who contribute to its development.

### Architecture

Component-Based Architecture
We followed a component-based architecture for this project, where each component represents a specific functionality or feature of the application. This approach allows for the separation of concerns and promotes code reusability, making it easier to maintain and scale the application.

### State Management
For state management, we used the react useState provided by ReactJS. This allows us to easily manage the state of the application and share it between components, without the need for additional third-party libraries.

### API Integration
We used the SpaceX API to fetch data for the application. We made use of the axios library to make HTTP requests to the API, which allowed us to easily integrate the API into the application.

### Conclusion
I hope that this README file has provided you with an understanding of the choice of frameworks and architecture used in the ReactJS SpaceX project using Tailwind CSS. I believe that the combination of ReactJS and Tailwind CSS provided us with a powerful set of tools to create a user-friendly and scalable web application.
